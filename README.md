Guide to LeetCode: A Personal Guide to the Most Common and Useful Patterns for Solving Algorithm Questions
Welcome to the Guide to LeetCode project! This repository is based on a Dev.to article written by Mario Ruci (https://dev.to/mrmarioruci/guide-to-leetcode-a-personal-guide-to-the-most-common-and-useful-patterns-for-solving-algorithm-questions-3p9e), where he breaks down the most common and useful patterns for solving algorithm questions on LeetCode. The goal of this guide is to help you tackle algorithm challenges with confidence by recognizing recurring problem-solving strategies.

üìñ Overview
This repository contains a curated collection of LeetCode patterns, techniques, and tips categorized to help you systematically approach problems. By understanding and practicing these patterns, you'll improve your ability to solve various algorithm questions efficiently.

Key Features:
Comprehensive Problem-Solving Patterns: Master essential patterns like the sliding window, two pointers, dynamic programming, and more.
Example Problems: Each pattern is accompanied by popular LeetCode problems, explanations, and solutions.
Optimized Code Snippets: Every pattern includes well-commented Python code examples that demonstrate how to apply the concepts.
Helpful Tips: Insightful tips are provided for each pattern, along with potential pitfalls to watch out for.
üîë Patterns Covered
Two Pointers
Efficient for solving problems involving arrays or linked lists.
Example: LeetCode #167: Two Sum II
Sliding Window
Ideal for problems involving subarrays or substrings.
Example: LeetCode #3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Fast & Slow Pointers
Useful for detecting cycles in linked lists or arrays.
Example: LeetCode #141: Linked List Cycle
Merge Intervals
Deals with problems involving ranges or intervals.
Example: LeetCode #56: Merge Intervals
Dynamic Programming
Best for optimization problems where decisions depend on previously solved subproblems.
Example: LeetCode #322: Coin Change
Backtracking
Used to explore all possible configurations to solve problems like generating combinations or solving mazes.
Example: LeetCode #46: Permutations
Binary Search
Efficient for problems involving sorted arrays or search spaces.
Example: LeetCode #33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS)
Used for solving graph problems, including finding connected components or shortest paths.
Example: LeetCode #200: Number of Islands
Greedy Algorithms
Solves problems step-by-step by choosing the locally optimal solution.
Example: LeetCode #55: Jump Game
