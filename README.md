# Guide to LeetCode: A Personal Guide to the Most Common and Useful Patterns for Solving Algorithm Questions

Welcome to the **Guide to LeetCode** project! This repository is based on a [Dev.to article](https://dev.to/mrmarioruci/guide-to-leetcode-a-personal-guide-to-the-most-common-and-useful-patterns-for-solving-algorithm-questions-3p9e) written by Mario Ruci, where he breaks down the most common and useful patterns for solving algorithm questions on LeetCode. The goal of this guide is to help you tackle algorithm challenges with confidence by recognizing recurring problem-solving strategies.

## ðŸ“– Overview

- **Example Problems**: Each pattern is accompanied by popular LeetCode problems, explanations, and solutions.
- **Optimized Code Snippets**: Every pattern includes well-commented Python code examples that demonstrate how to apply the concepts.
- **Helpful Tips**: Insightful tips are provided for each pattern, along with potential pitfalls to watch out for.

## ðŸ”‘ Patterns Covered

1. **Two Pointers**
   - Efficient for solving problems involving arrays or linked lists.
   - Example: [LeetCode #167: Two Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
   
2. **Sliding Window**
   - Ideal for problems involving subarrays or substrings.
   - Example: [LeetCode #3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
   
3. **Fast & Slow Pointers**
   - Useful for detecting cycles in linked lists or arrays.
   - Example: [LeetCode #141: Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
   
4. **Merge Intervals**
   - Deals with problems involving ranges or intervals.
   - Example: [LeetCode #56: Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
   
5. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Best for optimization problems where decisions depend on previously solved subproblems.
   - Example: [LeetCode #322: Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)
   
6. **Backtracking**
   - Used to explore all possible configurations to solve problems like generating combinations or solving mazes.
   - Example: [LeetCode #46: Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)
   
7. **Binary Search**
   - Efficient for problems involving sorted arrays or search spaces.
   - Example: [LeetCode #33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
   
8. **Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS)**
   - Used for solving graph problems, including finding connected components or shortest paths.
   - Example: [LeetCode #200: Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
   
9. **Greedy Algorithms**
   - Solves problems step-by-step by choosing the locally optimal solution.
   - Example: [LeetCode #55: Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)
